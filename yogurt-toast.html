    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Custard Yogurt Toast has been trending on Tiktok for months. I was a little skeptical to try it at first as I was worried it may taste “eggy”, but I can assure you it doesn't! I was actually surprised how much it tasted like custard </p>
    <p>If you don't have an air fryer, don't stress! I've also tested the oven method noted below which worked great too!</p>
