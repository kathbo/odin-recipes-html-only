    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Salmon and Rice Bowl is a TikTok viral sensation, it’s so simple to make using leftover rice and salmon! Serve with Japanese mayo, soy sauce, diced avocado, and roasted seaweed sheets!</p>
    <p>If you’ve been on TikTok recently, you’ve probably seen mounds of videos recreating the viral salmon rice bowl from TikTok creator, Emily Mariko. She made a Salmon Rice Bowl using left over salmon and rice, and an ice cube( that’s right!), soy sauce, Sriracha, Japanese Kewpie mayo and, to serve, sliced avocado, kimchi and roasted seaweed snacks. After watching her video, I knew I needed to recreate it and I’m here to tell you it’s worth the hype!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon fillet</li>
        <li>Leftover rice</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sriracha</li>
        <li>Kewpie mayo</li>
        <li>Roasted seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Kimchi</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the salmon filet, assuming it’s leftover, and shred it onto a plate until it’s broken up into small pieces. I use a fork to do this.</li>
        <li>Add the leftover rice right over the salmon, then place one ice cube in the center right in the middle of the rice.</li>
        <li>Cover with parchment paper or a paper towel and microwave on high for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove bowl from microwave and discard any remaining ice.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce, the light homemade kewpie mayonnaise and sriracha.</li>
        <li>Mix until rice/salmon are well combined.</li>
        <li>Top with diced avocado and more mayonnaise, more sriracha and soy sauce, if desired.</li>
        <li>You can eat as is or add kimchi and/or wrap the salmon mixture in your seaweed sheets and enjoy as mini-roll ups!</li>
    </ol>
