    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I’m on a mug cake streak. I have been making mug cakes every day for a sweet treat to cap off the night. Is it wrong to have cake everyday? Maybe it’s wrong, but it feels so right, especially when it’s Oreo mug cake!</p>
    <p>I ended up liking my Oreo mug cake better. It was more moist and fluffy and it tasted more like cake. The Oreo and milk only mug cake was good…if you’re desperate. JK JK it tastes kind of like a very dense chocolate cake. It was a little molten and gooey in the centre.</p>
